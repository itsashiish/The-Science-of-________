An interactive single-page application (SPA) that synthesizes key psychological and sociological research regarding the use of profanity. This project transforms static academic findings into an interactive narrative using dynamic data visualizations.

## 📋 Overview

This application breaks down the mechanics of swearing into four distinct domains:

1.  **⚡ Physical:** The hypoalgesic (pain-relieving) effects of swearing (Stephens et al.).
2.  **🧠 Cognitive:** The correlation between taboo vocabulary and general verbal fluency (Jay et al.).
3.  **🤝 Social:** The perception of profanity in various social contexts (Work vs. Casual).
4.  **🚫 Habituation:** The diminishing returns of frequent swearing.
